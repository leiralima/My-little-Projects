# My-little-Projects
This is my repository where I store the programs I create. Usually stuff I do to learn new things.

This is a summary of my programs so far:
* Calcutalor1: a simple calculator that does the four basic mathematical operations.
* ContactsBook: a virtual contacts book.
* Number Operations on Pytho: simple program that does the four basic math operations with two given numbers.
* NumberChecker: simple program that does various types of checks with a given number.
* Scrambler: program that mixes two given strings and also separate a string into two new strings.
